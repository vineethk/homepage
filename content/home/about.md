I am a Principal Scientist at GrammaTech, Inc: I manage and lead the research area "big code", which intersects static program analysis with statistical and machine learning. I live in the lovely finger lakes region in upstate NY. 

At GrammaTech, we work on several fun, cutting-edge research projects. Some of the projects we work on are listed [here](https://www.grammatech.com/sponsored-research). We have openings for researchers, software engineers, and interns (throughout the year). If what we do sounds interesting to you, and you would like to work with us or do an internship, please drop me an email!

I have had the good fortune of working with several amazing interns over the past few years: [Lawton Nichols](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/people/graduate/nichols), [Yanxin Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OPr6IOkAAAAJ), [Kevin Leach](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7nSw4Q8AAAAJ), [Prashast Srivastava](https://prashast.github.io/), [Sushant Dinesh](https://sushant94.me/about/), [Charlie Murphy](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~tcm3/), [Colin Unger](https://ucsb-ccs-computing.github.io/students/unger_colin/), Avi Saven. 

Previously, I was a graduate researcher at the [Programming Languages Lab](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~benh/research/research.html),  University of California Santa Barbara. My PhD advisor was [Ben Hardekopf](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~benh/research/research.html). During the summers of 2011 and 2012, I was a research intern at Mozilla Research, working with [Dave Herman](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2017/11/getting-to-know-dave-herman). I worked for a couple of years at National Instruments R&D, Bangalore, right after my undergrad (and developed [this](http://www.ni.com/tutorial/7386/en/) LabVIEW feature).
